# 👋 Hello, I'm Ahsan Abdul Salam

I am a versatile Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, primarily focused on backend development and scalable system architecture, with solid full-stack experience. I have built robust backend services and APIs using C#, Java, Python, Django, ASP.NET, and SQL-based systems, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, performance optimization, and maintainability.

Alongside backend development, I have worked on full-stack applications using Angular (including Angular 17), integrating responsive frontends with RESTful APIs and real-time services. I am experienced with relational and NoSQL databases, caching solutions like Redis, and containerized environments using Docker and Linux, contributing to CI/CD-driven workflows.

Through my experience at 42 Wolfsburg and SEA:ME, I also gained hands-on exposure to embedded systems and automotive software using C/C++, CAN, and Linux-based platforms. This foundation enhances my understanding of system performance and low-level optimization, complementing my backend expertise.

I enjoy building scalable backend systems while maintaining the ability to contribute across the full stack and understand software from hardware-level considerations to modern web applications.
