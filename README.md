# 👋 Hello, I'm Ahsan Abdul Salam  

I am a versatile Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, primarily focused on **backend development and scalable system architecture**, with solid **full-stack experience**. I build robust backend services and APIs using **C#, Java, Python, Django, ASP.NET, and SQL-based systems**, emphasizing clean architecture, performance, and maintainability.  

Alongside backend work, I have experience in **full-stack development using Angular (including Angular 17)**, integrating responsive frontends with RESTful APIs and real-time services. I am comfortable working with **relational and NoSQL databases, caching solutions like Redis, and containerized environments using Docker and Linux**, contributing to CI/CD-driven workflows.  

Additionally, I have hands-on exposure to **embedded systems and automotive software** (C/C++, CAN, Linux), which strengthens my understanding of **system performance, low-level optimization, and hardware-software integration**.  

I enjoy building scalable backend systems while maintaining the ability to contribute across the **full stack**, combining a deep technical foundation with practical experience in modern web and embedded technologies.
